                        The purpose of this application is to provide a platform for users
                        to find information about a restaurant such as food reviews from 
                        other users, cuisine, address, etc.. Users will be able to find restaurants 
                        based on the ratings given to them from other users.

                        This is a quote game application. The home page displays a 
                        random quote upon loading. You can search for a quote by a 
                        famous person on the homepage.
                        On the Game Page of the application, a random quote is displayed 
                        with a missing word. You are to enter in the missing word. 
                        You can also, generate a new quote by clicking on the 
                        "Generate new quote" button. This is still a work in progress. 
                        Haven't finished the styling of the application. 
                        The purpose of building this application was to familiarise myself with React concepts.

                        This is a roulette game application made for the terminal. 
                        It was made using the Python programming language and was the first 
                        programming assignment from Coder Academy. This application simulates the 
                        game of Roulette. It has a main menu with three options, play game, view results,
                        or exit the application. The game has features like, place bets on multiple 
                        numbers, calculating amount won or lost, and seeing remaining funds. This 
                        was a fun application to build as their was some complicated logic involved with it.
